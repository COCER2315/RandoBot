# SurveyBot

A collection of bots written in Python that automates simple tasks for myself(owner of the repository).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note to visitors:
* answer_bot is discontinued due to PyAutoGUI's locate functions not working correctly on a Mac, the x coordinates in particular. Other bots are still implementable but coordinates for clicks have to be hardcoded. Although losing portability is not a concern(see [disclaimer](#disclaimer)), I will still continue the search for solutions.
* Duplicate screenshots were necessary in the streamlined directory due to file access permission issues that would otherwise occur.

**Disclaimer: the main purpose of this repository is to showcase and to keep a backup of code. Though distribution and use is not forbidden(unless by the license), this bot is not meant for others' use.**
